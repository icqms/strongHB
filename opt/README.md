.sel means selected atoms. This brings all the bits back together.

This is an example:
 F    1    36     N   1 GLY 3 - A       1   3
 
 F=Fixed(capital in QM), o= optimized, l=MM layer 
 
 1= atom index in gaussian
 
 36=atom index in hin file 
 
 N = nitrogen atom 
 
 1 = molecule index
 
 GLY = residue name
 
 3 = residue index
 
 - = hyperchem format, not important
 - 
 A = chain name

 1 = molecule index after expansion 
 
 3 = residue index after expansion
