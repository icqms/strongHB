.sel means selected atoms. This brings all the bits back together.

This is an example:
 F    1    36     N   1 GLY 3 - A       1   3
 F=Fixed(capital in QM) 
 1= atom index in gaussian
 36=atom index in hin file 
 N = nitrogen atom 
 1 = molecule index
 GLY = residue name
 3 = residue index
 - = hyperchem format, not important
 A = chain name
 1 = need to check, unclear at the moment 
 3 = need to check, unclear at the moment
